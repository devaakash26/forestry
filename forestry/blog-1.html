            <h4 id="description-first-title">What is a Forest?

            </h4>

            <p></p>
            <p>A forest is defined as the area of land that is covered by trees. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations defined forest as “Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in this situation”. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use. 

            </p><br>
            <p>By using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 has concluded that the total forest lands cover about 4.06 million hectares or 10 million acres of land which sums up to 31% of the total land on the Earth’s surface in the year 2020. </p>
            <p>Forests are important for the survival of all living beings. They are vital for our life as they provide oxygen, food, shelter, fuel, and means of livelihood for the tribal people living in and around the forest area. Forests are home to 80% of the global terrestrial biodiversity and are the source that fulfills all basic needs for adjacent human settlements. Everything from the oxygen we breathe to the wood used from fuel to use in construction comes from forests. It is a self-nourishing system, which is a host to a number of organisms. The ecosystem of every forest includes both biotic (living) and non-biotic components. The biotic components include plants, trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, mosses, algae, fungi, insects, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and microorganisms. </p>
          
            <h4>Forests are Made of Four Main Layers as Shown Below. </h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Emergent Layer: The tallest trees in the forest are around 200 feet from the emergent layer. These trees have broad leaves and get abundant sunlight. </li>
                <li> Canopy Layer: The canopy layer is just below the emergent layer. It is thickened by a maze of smooth oval leaves and branches. It is the primary layer of the forest.</li>
                <li> Understory Layer: Sunlight cannot reach the layers below the canopy layer and hence the plants develop larger leaves to absorb it. </li>
                <li> Forest Floor: Sunlight cannot reach the forest floor and hence, it is dark and humid in this layer. It offers a rich source for the growth of fungus. Dead leaves, branches, and dead animals decay in this layer. </li>
            </ol>

            <p></p>
            <p>There are three major forest zones based on the distance from the equator, which are

</p>
<ol>
    <li> Tropical, </li>
    <li> Temperate, and</li>
    <li> Boreal forests. </li>
</ol>
<br>
            <p>Tropical rainforests have different subcategories as follows:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Evergreen</li>
                <li>Seasonal</li>
                <li>Dry</li>
                <li>Tropical and subtropical </li>
                <li>Montane</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Subcategories of temperate forests include moist conifer, evergreen broad-leaved, dry conifer, Mediterranean, and temperate broad-leaved rainforest. Boreal forests grow in higher latitudes, where the temperatures reach the freezing point.</p>
            
            <h4>Types of Forests</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>Forests are primarily referred to as the terrestrial ecosystem of the Earth. They are widely spread all over the surface of the Earth. The majority of the forest land is concentrated in just 5 major countries and those are Brazil, the United States, China, Canada, and the Russian Federation. About 45% of the forest land that is the largest forest share is in the tropical zone followed by temperate, boreal, and subtropic domains. Thus, the forests are divided into three major types as follows.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><h5>Tropical Forests:</h5>Tropical forests generally lie between 23.50 N and 23.50 S latitudes. The temperature that prevails in this forest is around 680 and 770 Fahrenheit throughout the year.  They normally experience 100 inches of rainfall every year and thus do not have any winter season. This type of forest avails broad leaves trees that are in majority in this forest and they normally grow 82 to 115 feet tall. Vines, ferns, mosses, orchids, and palms are the alternative variations that are found here. The various categories of tropical forests are evergreen, seasonal, dry, montane, tropical and subtropical, coniferous, and subtropical. </li><br>
                <li><h5>Temperate Forests:</h5>The temperate forest is further divided into two subcategories and those are temperate deciduous forests and temperate coniferous forests. Temperate deciduous forests are mostly found in Japan, China, Europe, and a few parts of Russia as well as in the eastern part of the United States and Canada. 

                    In this forest, precipitation occurs all year long and it experiences distinctive seasons. Precipitation comes in the form of rain in spring, summer, and fall and it snows heavily in winters. Temperate deciduous forest saves a range of about 30 to 60 inches annually and thus the soils are very fertile here. The floor of this forest is covered with ferns, mosses, and wildflowers. Oak, apples, and birch trees are the dominant trees of this forest. </li><br>
                <li><h5>Boreal Forests:</h5>Boreal forests are also known as taiga forests, better found between 50 and 60 degrees north latitude. Siberia, Canada, North Asia, and Scandinavia are a few of the areas that have boreal forests. About 65% of the boreal forests are concentrated in Scandinavia. These forests are characterized by very long winters and very short summers. They receive between 15 and 40 inches of precipitation annually, most of which is snow. They have an undermined rate of decomposition and a very thin layer of soil because of the very cold temperature. The trees that are found in these forests are mostly evergreen trees. Some of the examples of these trees are pine, spruce, and fir. Due to its very dense canopy, it has very limited vegetation. </li><br>
            </ul>
           
            <h4>What is the Importance of Forests?
            </h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>Forests are natural habitats for many animals. The trees supply oxygen to the atmosphere. They affect the rainfall in a particular region. They also provide us with wood, medicines, food, perfumes, paper, clothes, etc. </p>
            <p>Trees are the world’s largest storehouses of carbon which is important to maintain global temperatures. The rise in carbon levels is believed to be the main reason behind global warming. In spite of the advantages of forests, deforestation has become very rampant in the modern era causing several problems like pollution, soil erosion, and climate change. Here are some of the reasons that explain the importance of forests for all living beings (See figure 1) and why they should be preserved proactively. </p>
            
            <h4>Uses of Trees to Absorb Greenhouse Gases
            </h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>Forests maintain the ecosystem by absorbing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that are believed to be the reason for climate change. Carbon is stored in the biomass within the forests. Tropical forests alone harbor a huge amount of carbon (around a quarter of a trillion tons) that can be disastrous if it is released into the atmosphere. </p>
          

            <h4>Importance of Trees to Provide a Natural Habitat
            </h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>Forests provide a sustainable environment for the survival of millions of animals. It is home to several species including snakes, turtles, crocodiles, insects, birds, butterflies, monkeys, and other wild animals. It provides an ecosystem for the animals to thrive. The forest floor is also a rich medium for microorganisms, which are essential for the conversion of dead matter into nutrients. Forests are also home to indigenous people who depend on them for their livelihood. </p>
           

            <h4>Importance of Forests to Support Biodiversity</h4>

            <p>Yes, you can do that as well. You own the domain name and can change its settings to point it to any
              web
              hosting company.</p>
            <p>For example, you purchased your domain name and hosting from Godaddy, and now you want to move your web
              hosting to Bluehost. You can move your site from one host to another by simply transferring files and
              data. After that you need to edit your domain name settings and point them to your new web hosting
              provider.</p>
            <p>Another example, you purchased your domain name from WordPress.com (See our guide on the difference
              between WordPress.com vs WordPress.org). Later you want to move to self hosted WordPress.org website.
            </p>
            <p>First, you will need to sign up for a WordPress hosting account. After that you can move your site from
              WordPress.com to WordPress.org. Lastly, you will just edit your domain name settings on WordPress.com
              and
              point them to your new WordPress hosting provider.

            </p>
            <p>We hope this article helped you learn the difference between a domain name and web hosting. You may
              also
